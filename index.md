The primary aim of the OWASP Large Language Model Security Verification Standard (LLMSVS) Project is to provide an open security standard for systems that leverage artificial intelligence and Large Language Models.

The standard provides a basis for designing, building, and testing robust LLM backed applications, including architectural, model lifecycle, model training, model operation and integration, model storage and monitoring concerns.

Initial Draft Version - 0.1

The latest stable version is version 0.1 (dated February 2024), which can be found:
* [OWASP Large Language Model Security Verification Standard 0.1 English (PDF)](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-llm-verification-standard/releases/tag/0.1)

The master branch of this repository will always be the "bleeding edge version" which might have in-progress changes or other edits open.
